## 🚀 About me

I'm a Senior JavaScript/TypeScript Engineer with 10+ years of experience building, leading, and scaling modern web applications.  
Currently working at **smartclip Europe GmbH**, but always curious about new challenges, meaningful products, and great teams.

- Strong focus on **architecture**, **type safety**, and **user-centric engineering**
- Passion for **building tools that actually help teams ship better software**
- Currently expanding my skills in **technical leadership** and **AI-driven product development**
- Looking to **connect**, **collaborate**, or just **exchange ideas**
